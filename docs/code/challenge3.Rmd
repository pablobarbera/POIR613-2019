The purpose of this challenge is to practice writing code that can run in parallel. We'll use simulation to solve the "birthday problem": given the number of people in this room, what is the probability that two people have the same birthday?

Here's the code to run this simulation using a standard loop in R:

```{r}
system.time({
# monte carlo simulation
k <- 15 # number of people in this room
sims <- 10000 # number of simulations 
duplicates <- rep(NA, sims) # vector with results
for (i in 1:sims) {
  days <- sample(1:365, k, replace = TRUE)
  days.unique <- unique(days) # unique birthdays
  ## if there are duplicates, the number of unique birthdays 
  ## will be less than the number of birthdays, which is `k'
  ## so here we say TRUE if there are 2+ people with same birthday
  duplicates[i] <- length(days.unique) < k

}
})

## fraction of trials where at least two bdays are the same
mean(duplicates)

```


Rewrite this loop using `%do%` from the `foreach` package. Make sure you use the correct function to combine. Does the running time increase or decrease?

```{r}



```

Now set up a cluster and parallelize the loop using `%dopar%`. Does the running time increase or decrease? What does it tell you about when it makes sense to parallelize?

```{r}



```

Now assume there's 100,000 million students in the class (one can dream...). Try re-running the previous code (let's increase it now to 1000 simulations to make it a bit more exciting). We already know the answer for the birthday problem with the sample size -- the probability will be 1. But what happens now with the running time? Why?


```{r}

# standard loop

system.time({
# monte carlo simulation
k <- 100000 # number of people in this room
sims <- 1000 # number of simulations 
duplicates <- rep(NA, sims) # vector with results
for (i in 1:sims) {
  days <- sample(1:365, k, replace = TRUE)
  days.unique <- unique(days) # unique birthdays
  ## if there are duplicates, the number of unique birthdays 
  ## will be less than the number of birthdays, which is `k'
  ## so here we say TRUE if there are 2+ people with same birthday
  duplicates[i] <- length(days.unique) < k

}
})

# parallelized foreach loop
