This RMarkdown offers an overview of the basic tools of text analysis that we will use in this course.

### String manipulation with R

We will start with basic string manipulation with R.

Our running example will be the set of tweets posted by Donald Trump's Twitter account since January 1st, 2018.

```{r}
library(streamR)
tweets <- parseTweets("data/trump-tweets.json")
head(tweets)
```

R stores the basic string in a character vector. `length` gets the number of items in the vector, while `nchar` is the number of characters in the vector.

```{r}
length(tweets$text)
tweets$text[1]
nchar(tweets$text[1])
```

Note that we can work with multiple strings at once.

```{r}
nchar(tweets$text[1:10])
sum(nchar(tweets$text[1:10]))
max(nchar(tweets$text[1:10]))
```

We can merge different strings into one using `paste`:
```{r}
paste(tweets$text[1], tweets$text[2], sep='--')
```

As we will see later, it is often convenient to convert all words to lowercase or uppercase.

```{r}
tolower(tweets$text[1])
toupper(tweets$text[1])
```

We can grab substrings with `substr`. The first argument is the string, the second is the beginning index (starting from 1), and the third is final index.

```{r}
substr(tweets$text[1], 1, 2)
substr(tweets$text[1], 1, 10)
```

This is useful when working with date strings as well:

```{r}
dates <- c("2015/01/01", "2014/12/01")
substr(dates, 1, 4) # years
substr(dates, 6, 7) # months
```

Let's dig into the data a little bit more. Given the source of the dataset, we can expect that there will be many tweets mentioning topics such as immigration or health care. We can use the `grep` command to identify these. `grep` returns the index where the word occurs.

```{r}
grep('immigration', tweets$text[1:25])
```

`grepl` returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`, indicating whether each element of the character vector contains that particular pattern.

```{r}
grepl("immigration", tweets$text[1:25])
```

Going back to the full dataset, we can use the results of `grep` to get particular rows. First, check how many tweets mention the word "immigration".

```{r}
nrow(tweets)
grep('immigration', tweets$text)
length(grep('immigration', tweets$text))

```

It is important to note that matching is case-sensitive. You can use the `ignore.case` argument to match to a lowercase version.

```{r}
nrow(tweets)
length(grep('immigration', tweets$text))
length(grep('immigration', tweets$text, ignore.case = TRUE))
```

Now let's try to identify what tweets are related to immigration and try to store them into a smaller data frame. How would we do it?

```{r}
immi_tweets <- tweets[grep('immigration', tweets$text, ignore.case=TRUE),]
```


### Regular expressions

Another useful tool to work with text data is called "regular expression". You can learn more about regular expressions [here](http://www.zytrax.com/tech/web/regex.htm). Regular expressions let us develop complicated rules for both matching strings and extracting elements from them. 

For example, we could look at tweets that mention more than one handle using the operator "|" (equivalent to "OR")

```{r}
nrow(tweets)
length(grep('immigration|immigrant', tweets$text, ignore.case=TRUE))
```

We can also use question marks to indicate optional characters.

```{r}
nrow(tweets)
length(grep('immigr?', tweets$text, ignore.case=TRUE))
```

This will match immigration, immigrant, immigrants, etc.

Other common expression patterns are:

- `.` matches any character, `^` and `$` match the beginning and end of a string.  
- Any character followed by `{3}`, `*`, `+` is matched exactly 3 times, 0 or more times, 1 or more times.  
- `[0-9]`, `[a-zA-Z]`, `[:alnum:]` match any digit, any letter, or any digit and letter.
- Special characters such as `.`, `\`, `(` or `)` must be preceded by a backslash.  
- See `?regex` for more details.

For example, how many tweets ends with an exclamation mark? How many tweets are retweets? How many tweets mention any username? And a hashtag?
```{r}
length(grep('!$', tweets$text, ignore.case=TRUE))
length(grep('^RT @', tweets$text, ignore.case=TRUE))
length(grep('@[A-Za-z0-9_]+', tweets$text, ignore.case=TRUE))
length(grep('#[A-Za-z0-9_]+', tweets$text, ignore.case=TRUE))
```

### More complex examples of regular expressions using stringr

`stringr` is an R package that extends the capabilities of R for manipulation of text. Let's say that e.g. we want to replace a pattern (or a regular expression) with another string:

```{r}
library(stringr)
str_replace(tweets$text[2], '@[0-9_A-Za-z]+', 'USERNAME')
```

Note this will only replace the _first_ instance. For all the instances, do:

```{r}
str_replace_all(tweets$text[2], '@[0-9_A-Za-z]+', 'USERNAME')
```

To extract a pattern we can use `str_extract`, and again we can extract one or all instances of the pattern:

```{r}
str_extract(tweets$text[2], '@[0-9_A-Za-z]+')
str_extract_all(tweets$text[2], '@[0-9_A-Za-z]+')
```

This function is vectorized, which means we can apply it to all elements of a vector simultaneously. That will give us a list, which we can then turn into a vector to get a frequency table of the most frequently mentioned handles or hashtags:

```{r}
handles <- str_extract_all(tweets$text, '@[0-9_A-Za-z]+')
handles[1:3]
handles_vector <- unlist(handles)
head(sort(table(handles_vector), decreasing = TRUE), n=10)

# now with hashtags...
hashtags <- str_extract_all(tweets$text, '#[A-Za-z0-9_]+')
hashtags[1:3]
hashtags_vector <- unlist(hashtags)
head(sort(table(hashtags_vector), decreasing = TRUE), n=10)

```
